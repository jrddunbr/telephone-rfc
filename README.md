# telephone RFC

Reference Telephone RFC can be found at [http://people.clarkson.edu/~jmatthew/networks/slides/TELEPHONE-RFC-1.7.txt](http://people.clarkson.edu/~jmatthew/networks/slides/TELEPHONE-RFC-1.7.txt), locally stored as well at the same filename

This is a fabricated RFC by the course instructors but has the correct formatting.

`states.txt`: A sort of state machine (DFA) that shows how the program flow should basically work

# Python Implementation

The Python 3 implementation is the implementation that I will use for the actual course. I may do another version in a different programming language later that may be more fun and interesting.

## Usage

```
python3 main.py <dest> [originator] [source]
```
